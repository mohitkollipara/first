## ðŸ”¹ Minor Project â€“ SVM-Based Image Classification

**Title:** Binary Image Classification using Support Vector Machine (SVM)  
**Objective:**  
Build a binary image classifier using traditional machine learning techniques, specifically Support Vector Machines.

### âœ… Highlights:
- Preprocessed and flattened image data to fit SVM requirements
- Trained using `scikit-learn` with hyperparameter tuning
- Achieved **[insert accuracy]%** accuracy on test data
- Evaluated model using a confusion matrix and classification report

**Tech Stack:**  
`Python`, `scikit-learn`, `NumPy`, `matplotlib`

## ðŸ”¸ Major Project â€“ CNN-Based Multi-Class Image Classification

**Title:** Multi-Class Image Classification using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)  
**Objective:**  
Design and train a CNN model to classify images into multiple categories using deep learning.

### âœ… Highlights:
- Built a custom CNN with multiple convolutional and pooling layers using `TensorFlow/Keras`
- Employed data augmentation for better generalization
- Implemented early stopping and model checkpointing
- Achieved **[insert accuracy]%** validation accuracy
- Visualized training/validation metrics and confusion matrix

**Tech Stack:**  
`Python`, `TensorFlow/Keras`, `OpenCV`, `NumPy`, `matplotlib`
